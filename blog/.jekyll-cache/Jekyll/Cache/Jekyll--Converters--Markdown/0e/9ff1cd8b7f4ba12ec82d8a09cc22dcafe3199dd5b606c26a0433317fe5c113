I"é<p>Hello! Itâ€™s me! Iâ€™m back and updating again. Iâ€™ll be honest, I donâ€™t feel like giving a whole update on where Iâ€™ve been. Short version is that the Pandemic happened, is still happening, and itâ€™s no different than everyone else. What is important however is that I had the opportunity to take stock of what frustrated me about my work and make a conscious decision to focus on the things I truly wanted to do. This is just a blurb, but Iâ€™ll get into it as tie goes on.</p>
